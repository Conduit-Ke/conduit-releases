# 📡 condu**IT** SMS Gateway - Official Releases

Welcome to the official distribution repository for the **conduIT SMS Gateway** edge node. This repository hosts signed production artifacts, changelogs, and security checksums for the Conduit Android platform.

## 🚀 Overview

The **conduIT Edge Node** is an enterprise-grade Android application designed for high-performance SMS routing. It acts as a bridge between the Conduit Cloud API and the mobile telephony stack, providing resilient, carrier-safe message delivery with bank-grade security.

### 🛠️ Key Capabilities
- **Per-SIM TPS Enforcement**: Precision rate limiting (1 TPS default) to ensure carrier compliance and prevent SIM blocking.
- **Intelligent SIM Health**: Automatic tiered quarantine and reputation scoring of local SIM slots.
- **Layered Security**: AES-256-GCM encrypted FCM control channel and HMAC-SHA256 payload integrity.
- **Durable Lifecycle**: Robust "Push-to-Queue" architecture with atomic leasing and exponential backoff recovery.
- **Immutable Governance**: Hash-chained local audit logging with server-side anchoring.
